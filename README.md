# Workshops 2018

## Introduction to PHP Extensions

**Instructor:** Derick Rethans

### Pre-Requisite

Before beginning this tutorial, you'll need a development environment with the following packages:

- Linux
- Compiler: gcc and clang are both excellent choices.
- Build tools: autoconf, automake, libtool
- (Optional) parser generators: re2c and bison
- PHP 7.x with development headers:
	- Either distro packages such as: php7 and php7-devel / php7-dev
	- PHP compiled from source and installed with sudo make install. If compiling from source, then the --enable-debug switch is recommended, as well as the optional re2c and bison packages.

You test whether the prerequisites are met by running `pecl install -f geospatial-beta`  works on the command line, without errors.

Debugging tools that could also be handy: gdb and valgrind, which they can install with their linux package managers too.
